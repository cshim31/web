<ul>
    <li> Group elements if theme applies to all elements within as much as possible (refer to LogoGroup in header) </li>
    <li> Therefore, it is necessary to instantiate styles as component </li>
    <li> Rest elements should display tag as the step of rendering (refer to line 320 ~ in Header.jsx)</li>
    <li> Assume components content predefined. Let function caller required to insert required parameteres instead of letting caller decide what contents to put in</li>
</ul>
